  By following specifications and developing structurally sound programs, ensuring the code being
produced and distributed is functional and secure eventually becomes habit. Having the capability to
test code being developed allows us the capacity to become a self-contained program monster. As a
program monster with the power to devour tasks {1 x 1} provides ourselves with a method of approach, and
resolution. If the task is not overwhelming in magnitude, there should be no task too large to identify
inadequacies within program code. In testing code, we allow ourselves to rationalize decisions made
during the coding process i.e., creating an array accessor method to update entries of a linked list
without having to reiterate the object already in place.  By developing great habits, developing
software that meets customer's needs turns in to when as opposed to how. Continuous Integration provides
the scope of post distribution in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), or the maintenance step of
the SDLC. observing patterns users develop and cross referencing them with other users can help identify
difficulties and complacent behaviors anywhere from accessing the application to exiting the system. As
a developer providing the tools necessary to maintain software security, and a simple end-user
experience to those users ensures users’ needs are modularly incorporated into our programs.  Through
developing software in a systematic and repeatable process, ensuring functional & secure software meets
users’ needs is simple in definition. Developing modular code provides the foundation to incorporate
existing API's as well as developing our own.
